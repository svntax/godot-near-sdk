		Notes on implementation strategy:

		Using schoolbook multiplication.
		Karatsuba would save a little in some cost models.

		Most multiplications by 2 and 19 are 32-bit precomputations;
		cheaper than 64-bit postcomputations.

		There is one remaining multiplication by 19 in the carry chain;
		one *19 precomputation can be merged into this,
		but the resulting data flow is considerably less clean.

		There are 12 carries below.
		10 of them are 2-way parallelizable and vectorizable.
		Can get away with 11 carries, but then data flow is much deeper.

		With tighter constraints on inputs can squeeze carries into int32.
